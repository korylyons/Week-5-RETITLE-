In Knight Rider, why does each LED require its own pin?
  Each LED is running something different. They are not doing the exact same thing at the same time, also
  only one side of the LED can fit into one pin.
Why is Knight Rider 2 in the Arduino tutorial so much shorter than Knight Rider 1?
  The second video only shows the program running, it lacks the tutorial that Knight Rider 1 showed.
What resistor value should be used with the LEDs?
  According to the Arduino website it is 220 Ohms.
